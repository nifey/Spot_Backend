2. The dark-brown centre of the spot later shrinks and appears sunken and the halo turns a darker brown.
3. Leaf tissue surrounding spots turns yellow.%%Biological control##The removal and destruction of badly spotted leaves ('trash') from banana plantations
Heavily diseased leaves can also be buried within the plantation or piled on top of one another to prevent the effective discharge of ascospores from most leaves.%%Chemical control##Planting the banana trees more than 1,000 meters above sea level and practicing multi-cropping, mixing the banana tree with other trees or vegetation.One form of chemical control is applying fungicides.
