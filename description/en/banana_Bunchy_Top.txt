Symptoms##1.These plants are typically stunted (under 1 m) and rarely produce fruit.
2.The leaves become progressively dwarfed, upright and bunched at the top of the plant.
3.The first symptoms are dark green streaks on the lower portion of the leaf's midrib and later on the secondary veins.%%Biological control##There is no cure for bunchy top. Regular inspections to detect and remove infected plants, and replanting with virus-indexed tissue-culture plantlets,which have been screened in a lab and certified 'virus-free', are the basis for good management.%%Chemical control##1.Diseased plants should first be sprayed with power kerosene or insecticide.
2.Control must be practised across the whole production area to avoid the rapid re-infection of virus-tested planting material
