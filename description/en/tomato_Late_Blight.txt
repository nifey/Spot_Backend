Symptoms##Leaves have large, dark brown blotches with a green gray edge; not confined by major leaf veins.
Infections progress through leaflets and petioles, resulting in large sections of dry brown foliage.
Stem infections are firm and dark brown with a rounded edge.
Firm, dark brown, circular spots grow to cover large parts of fruits.%%Biological control##Destroy tomato cull piles before the growing season begins by burying them, spreading and incorporating them into fields, or feeding them to animals.
Control volunteer potato plants, as infected plants can grow from infected tubers.
Seed infection is unlikely on commercially prepared tomato seed or on saved seed that has been thoroughly dried.%%Chemical control##Fungicide applications should be made prior to infection when environmental conditions favor disease to be the most effective.
Phytophthora infestans is a water mold and not a true fungus.
